merged 2019 and 2023 Poland parliament elections data base // scalona baza wyborcza z 2019 i 2023 roku, wybory parlamentarne (komisje niecałkowicie się pokrywają)

### final_final file  - 6 excess 2023 venues determined to have existed in 2019; the error is likely a consequence of the imperfect string fit (fixed for all 2019 venues). sejm and senat separated; columns such as votes via post were not included, a few variables only available for 2019/2023 were also omitted. 
### the other file - venue correspondence determined, dupplicates not deleted.
